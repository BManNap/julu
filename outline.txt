scene 1
-Flavius
Hence! Home, you idle creatures get you home:
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
-question: what is Flavius asking? answer: what is your trade

-Marullus
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on? —
[To Cobbler] You, sir, what trade are you?
-Cobbler
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
as you would say, a cobbler.
-question:What is a cobbler?answer:mender and maker of shoes

Marullus
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
-Cobbler
A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
-Marullus
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
-Cobbler
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
-Marullus
What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
-Cobbler
Why, sir, cobble you.
-Flavius
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
-Cobbler
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl.  I meddle
with no tradesman's matters, nor women’s matters, but
with all. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when
they are in great danger I recover them. As proper men
as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my
handiwork.
-Flavius
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
-Cobbler
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday, to see
Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
-question:Why are they out in the streets?answer:To celabrate Caesar
